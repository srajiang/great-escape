# Great Bento Escape

You are a little tamago roll trying to escape the bento. Don't fall off the sushi platters and get points for leaping successfuly to freedom. 

## Background

A popular WeChat mini program game called Jump Jump became very popular earlier this year and is frustrating, delightful and addictive. I wanted to see what it takes to make a truly delightful game play experience so I built a game which shares a similar mechanic.

## Game Mechanic

The premise of the game is fairly simple, the user holds their finger/mouse on the screen to "launch" the figurine and make them jump from platform to platform. You accrue points as you jump, and get more points if you launch yourself right onto the center of the platform. You win when you reach the end of the platforms (i.e. a score of 99999) and you lose when you fall off the platforms.
